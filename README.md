# CSMI_Notes

This note repository records the course notes of the CSMI at the University of Strasbourg.

## Attention!

The notes are under construction, and omissions and confusion are very common.

If you want to read my notes, you should install `Obsidian` and enable the `TikZJax` plugin. This will allow you to correctly display the TikZ images in the notes.

If you find any errors in the notes, please submit an issue.
