## Slide 1: Overall Architecture & Objectives

---

**Speaker Notes:**

- Welcome! Today, I will present an example of both of these design patterns, using a matrix computation library.
- This program supports the creation, display, and decomposition of dense, sparse, and symmetric matrices.
- To achieve this, we applied two key design patterns to solve common challenges in scientific computing:
    1. **Global Configuration (Singleton Pattern):**
        - Ensures consistent settings like precision, thread count, and memory strategy across all modules.
    2. **Flexible Object Creation (Factory Method):**
        - Dynamically creates different matrix types with loose coupling, making the system scalable and maintainable.
    3. **Concurrency Support:**
        - Enables safe, parallel processing of matrix objects in a multithreaded environment.
- This combination leads to a robust, efficient, and scalable solution for matrix-based scientific computations.

## Slide 2: Singleton Pattern for Global Configuration

---

**Speaker Notes:**

- Let’s dive into how we manage global settings using the Singleton Pattern.
- The `GlobalConfig` class is designed to ensure that there’s only one configuration instance throughout the program.
- **Key Features:**
    - Private constructor prevents accidental instantiation.
    - A static pointer (`instance_`) holds the only instance of the configuration.
    - `GetInstance()` method gives global access to settings like precision, thread count, and memory strategy.
- This approach guarantees data consistency and efficient resource utilization.
- On the slide, you can see the UML diagram showing how `GlobalConfig` ensures a single access point for global settings.

## Slide 3: Factory Method Pattern for Matrix Creation

---

**Speaker Notes:**

- Next, let’s look at how we use the Factory Method Pattern for creating matrix objects.
- This pattern separates object creation from object usage, making the system flexible and easy to extend.
- **Structure Overview:**
    - **Abstract Base Class (`Matrix`)**: Defines the common interface with two key methods:
        - `Display()` – to output matrix content.
        - `Decompose()` – to simulate matrix decomposition.
    - **Concrete Classes:**
        1. `DenseMatrix`: Uses a 2D vector for data, supports LU decomposition.
        2. `SparseMatrix`: Stores only non-zero elements, supports QR decomposition.
        3. `SymmetricMatrix`: Enforces symmetry, supports SVD decomposition.
    - **MatrixFactory:** Centralized factory that creates different matrix types using static methods.
- This design allows us to easily add new matrix types without modifying the core logic.

## Slide 4: Factory Method UML Diagram

---

**Speaker Notes:**

- This slide presents the UML diagram of the Factory Method structure implemented in our program.
- The abstract class `Matrix` serves as the foundation, defining shared attributes like `rows_` and `cols_` and core methods such as `Display()` and `Decompose()`.
- Derived classes specialize this base:
    - **`DenseMatrix`** stores data in a 2D vector and supports LU decomposition.
    - **`SparseMatrix`** uses a vector of `Element` objects to store only non-zero values, supporting QR decomposition.
    - **`SymmetricMatrix`** maintains symmetry in its 2D vector storage and supports SVD decomposition.
- The **`MatrixFactory`** simplifies object creation with static methods for each matrix type, promoting scalability.
- This modular structure ensures new matrix types can be added with minimal code changes, enhancing flexibility and maintainability.

## Slide 5: Integrated Implementation & Demonstration

---

**Speaker Notes:**

- Let’s now see how these design patterns work together in practice.

**Integration Highlights:**

- **Singleton (GlobalConfig):** Provides a single, consistent configuration across all modules.
- **Factory Method (MatrixFactory):** Simplifies and standardizes the creation of various matrix types.

**Demonstration Functions:**

1. `ConfigDemo()` – Initializes and displays the global configuration.
2. `DenseMatrixDemo()` – Creates a dense matrix, displays data, and simulates LU decomposition.
3. `SparseMatrixDemo()` – Creates a sparse matrix, adds non-zero elements, and simulates QR decomposition.
4. `SymmetricMatrixDemo()` – Creates a symmetric matrix, ensures symmetry, and simulates SVD decomposition.
5. `ThreadFunc()` – Demonstrates multithreaded matrix creation and processing.

**Result:**

- This integrated design ensures consistent settings, flexible object creation, and safe concurrency.
- It provides a powerful, scalable solution for scientific computing.
